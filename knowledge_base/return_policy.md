**If No Exception Applies:**
*"I sincerely apologize, but I'm unable to process a return for this item as it falls outside our 30-day return window. I understand this is disappointing, and I wish I could make an exception in this case. However, our policy ensures fairness for all customers. Is there anything else I can help you with today, such as finding accessories or similar items you might enjoy?"*
